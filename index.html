		<h1>Beyond Vision</h1>

		<p>Beyond Vision is a platform for building virtual-reality and augmented-reality experiences. They are focused on acquiring and onboarding enterprise-level clients. Their image is sleek, high-end, and reliable.</p>

		<h2>Virtuous Design System</h2>

		<p>I chose to name my design system "Virtuous Design System" because the word <em>virtual</em> is derived from Latin <em>virtus</em>. Virtuous is defined as having high moral standards. Beyond Vision is focused on acquiring enterprise-level clients who will have high standards for the product and want to ensure the product is reliable so I chose a name that portrays these qualities and meets the standards of those clients.</p>

		<h2>Identity Keywords</h2>

		<h3>Bio</h3>

		<p>I am an Austin-based UX/UI and Graphic Designer. Before entering the design field, I earned a BA in Psychology from UT Austin while working in hospital settings. Through those experiences I knew I wanted to help people. I’ve been working as a Graphic Designer now for 3 years at a print production company in Austin while studying User Experience Design at the local community college. I’m excited to work in an area of design where I can merge my experiences in Psychology and Graphic Design to help solve design problems and improve the user experience.</p>
